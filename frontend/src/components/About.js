                    These are what come to mind when I think about who I am. Hi! My name is Ted Neben and I am an aspiring Software Engineer looking to make an impact 
                    in my field and make a name for myself. My drive is met with my passion for people. Connecting with others and finding 
                    purpose among each other lifts me to higher standards that, in the long run, lead to better endeavours for everyone around. 
                    My goal and objective with every new opportunity is to connect, create, and drive forward any and all plans to ensure growth 
                    for everyone. Having owned and operated 2 businesses and worked for myself in Freelance Photography and Videography, has given 
                    me experience that most miss out on. Having leadership qualities not only allows you to see from the helm, but allows you to see 
                    where things can be improved upon as well. However, every great mind starts out by being humble, and there is nothing short of that 
                    here. I want to be able to learn from my mistakes, my success, and my thought process to give my work the best chance of being at its 
                    top performance. I have led several people, in-person and online, to meet day to day operations and continually grow as a business and 
                    individually. The wrap up, I am ultimately a human. Someone who understands that mistakes exist in this world, but someone who also 
                    understands that greatness is sought after the first fall. I enjoy meeting challenges head on and not only learning how to approach that 
                    particular case, but how to learn from it and help approach everything else I come across as well. Putting one foot in front of the other 
                    is my approach to making a mark on this world.
